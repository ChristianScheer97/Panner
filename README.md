Audio-PlugIn to control the WFS-Software via OSC.
Check out the GUI in the pictures in the main directory to get an impression.
To build it you need to install the JUCE framework (https://juce.com/get-juce/download) and open the "Code/Panner.jucer" inside the Projucer software.
There you can export it into your IDE and build it.
You can find a built VST3 file in the main directory.
